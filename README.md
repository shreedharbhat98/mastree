## Instructions to run the programs :


* Task 1 : URLs are strings with a simple syntax:
    * While invoking the `acceptUrl` function pass the `url` as an string.
    * To run the program : `node urlParser.js`

* Task 2 : Flip the bits:
    * While invoking the `main` function pass the `N` as an Number.
    * In this program function `generateMatrix` will generate the initial score board. By randomizing the initial score board, I will prepare the target board.
    * To run the program : `node flipTheBits.js`


* Task 3 : Climb Stairs:
    * While invoking the `main` function pass the `total number of steps` as first argument and `array of steps that can a man climb` as the    second argument. I'm assuming that if there is no second argument person can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    * To run the program : `node climbStairs.js `
